# RESTful API with Authentication -- Back-End
RESTful API which handles logs of items on a food menu. The database used in the back-end is MongoDB.
##
This is the back-end of the database I created using this [guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-restful-api-with-authentication-under-5-minutes-using-loopback-by-expressjs-no-programming-31231b8472ca/). The front-end can be viewed in the restaurant-app folder.
##
The project was generated using [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
